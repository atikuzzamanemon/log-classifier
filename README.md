Log Classification With Hybrid Classification Framework
This project implements a hybrid log classification system, combining three complementary approaches to handle varying levels of complexity in log patterns. The classification methods ensure flexibility and effectiveness in processing predictable, complex, and poorly-labeled data patterns.

Classification Approaches
Regular Expression (Regex):

Handles the most simplified and predictable patterns.
Useful for patterns that are easily captured using predefined rules.
Sentence Transformer + Logistic Regression:

Manages complex patterns when there is sufficient training data.
Utilizes embeddings generated by Sentence Transformers and applies Logistic Regression as the classification layer.
LLM (Large Language Models):

Used for handling complex patterns when sufficient labeled training data is not available.
Provides a fallback or complementary approach to the other methods.

Folder Structure
training/:

Contains the code for training models using Sentence Transformer and Logistic Regression.
Includes the code for regex-based classification.
models/:

Stores the saved models, including Sentence Transformer embeddings and the Logistic Regression model.
resources/:

This folder contains resource files such as test CSV files, output files, images, etc.
Root Directory:

Contains the FastAPI server code (server.py).
Setup Instructions
Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Install the required Python libraries by running the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the FastAPI Server: To start the server, use the following command:

uvicorn server:app --reload
Once the server is running, you can access the API at:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/ (Main endpoint)
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs (Interactive Swagger documentation)
http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc (Alternative API documentation)
Usage
Upload a CSV file containing logs to the FastAPI endpoint for classification. Ensure the file has the following columns:

source
log_message
The output will be a CSV file with an additional column target_label, which represents the classified label for each log entry.
